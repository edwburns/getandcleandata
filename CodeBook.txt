Code Book for Coursera course project, Getting and Cleaning Data, Week four.

Objectives:
(Taken form Course instructions.)

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the
following:

 * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each   measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The data comes from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.  This includes the feature_info.txt file noted below with the description of the observations.


run_analysis creates a data set that holds the following data:

subject: this is the number assigned the participant in the observation period.  There were 30 participants.

activity: this is the activity which was undertaken for the observations.
they were 
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

The observations making up the resulting data consisted of different measures of means and standard deviations. They were found by searching the feature names for "Mean", "mean", "std" or "Std"

The data set created by run_analysis.R shows the MEAN values for these observations by subject (participant) and activity. Hence, the data lables noted above are prefixed by "MeanOf-".

A description of these measures is included in the text file features_info.txt which was noted above.
